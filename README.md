# OPie Continued

This is a fan update of the addon [OPie](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/opie) by Foxlit who no longer maintains their addons.

## Changes

### Ys 1
- Updated TOC for patch 9.2.5
- Removed hardcoded checks for covenant hearthstone toys, since they can be used by anyone once you reach Renown 80
- The Broker Translocation Matrix toy now displays properly
- Added code to override slice color by icon ID through a global table (Example: ``ZA.IconColors["MyTexture"] = 'ff00ff'``)
  - This lets third-party addons set the automatic color for specific textures, which is useful if you are using custom made icons

Last official release was Xe 6 on Jun 28, 2021

All of the original code was written by Foxlit. I claim no rights to anything in this repository.

Technically I have no rights to update the addon, even though it can be considered abandonware. It was released without a license which under US law defaults to "all rights reserved". I have chosen to ignore this for the time being.

If you have any issues with this repository or would like me to take it down, please [get in touch](mailto:hello@leo.fisk) and I will make sure to respond as soon as possible.
