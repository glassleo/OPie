# OPie, Continued

This is a fan update of the World of Warcraft addon [OPie](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/opie) written by Foxlit who no longer maintains their addons.

Due to any potential legal issues the addon will not be released on Curse or Wago.

## Changes

### Ys 1
- Updated TOC for patch 9.2.5
- Removed hardcoded checks for covenant hearthstone toys, since they can be used by anyone once you reach Renown 80
- The Broker Translocation Matrix toy now displays properly
- Added code to override slice color by icon ID through a global table (Example: ``ZA.IconColors["MyTexture"] = 'ff00ff'``)
  - This lets third-party addons set the automatic color for specific textures, which is useful if you are using custom made icons
