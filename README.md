# OPie Continued

This is a fan update of the addon [OPie](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/opie) by Foxlit who no longer maintains his addons.

Unfortunately copyright is a thing and Foxlit is somewhat of an asshole when it comes to letting people continue where he left off. While he has every right to do so legally, it really sucks for everyone who have come to rely on the addons.

Here I am ignoring copyright law, which is why this repo is currently private. Will need to find a better solution long-term.
